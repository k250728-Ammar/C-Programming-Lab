# C language Syntax

Below is a simple code to print "Hello World":

`#include <stdio.h>`

`int main() {`
   
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    
    return 0;
`}`

## Important Points:

Use **#include** to include standard libraries.

Functions like **printf()** come from the stdio.h library.

Every C program must have a **main()** function.

Use **comments** (// for single-line, /* */ for multi-line) to describe your code.

## Task List:

 1) Add *Hello World* example
 2) Demonstrate *basic data types*
 3) Add examples for control structures
 4) Add pointer explanation
 5) Include file handling examples

## Common Mistakes:

~~Forgetting semicolons at the end of statements~~

This is a common issue. Always end statements with a **;** in C!
